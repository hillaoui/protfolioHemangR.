                            I also have a deep understanding of different layer 2 protocols like VLAN, VTP, STP, RPVST, Port Security and Ether Channels (LACP/PAGP). My experience extends to many domains such as Data-Center Nexus 2148T, 2224T, 5548P, 5596T, 7009,7018 and 6000 switches
                            and configuring and fixing troublshoots problems of various Layer 3 protocols such as RIP, OSPF, EIGRP and BGP and supporting site-to-site and remote access Cisco, IPSec and VPN solutions using ASA/PIX firewalls. </p>
                        <p class="about-wrapper__info-text">
                            In addition, I implemented VDC, VPC, VRF and OTV on the Nexus 5505 and 7009 switches and VSS on Cisco Catalyst 6509 and 6513 switches. I have practical knowledge of TACACS, AAA, IPSEC, 802.x and public/private key encrypition and I worked on F5 LTM and GTM series
                            like 6400, 6800 and 88-- for the corporate applications and their availability.</p>

                                    In this project, I constructed wireless network topology in OPNET which connects various computers to a single network. Additionally, I analyzed the result of the attack which revealed the decrement in throughput of nodes and increase in delay by implementing
                                    Jamming Attack. Finally, I used channel switching attack to resolve the attack.

                            were an added value to my knowledge, such as monitoring performance and ensure system availability and reliability, configuring and install various network devices and services, performing OS upgrades on various Catalyst series
                            switches and maintained latest OS versions according to company’s policy, providing network support, installation, and analysis for a broad range of LAN / WAN / MAN communication systems, Involved in troubleshooting of DNS,
                            DHCP and other IP conflict problems. I am as well very experienced in Data-center nexus. When it comes to the soft skills, I am organised and able to priorities the workload, I am able to manage stress and to visualize, articulate,
                            and solve both complex and uncomplicated problems and concepts and make decisions that are sensible and based on available information, in addition to my eye for details. Effective communication is my top strength because listening
                            to customers, clients, or project partners, problem-solving becomes much more difficult and time-consuming, particularly the ability to communicate with staff who aren't technically trained. In addition to my ability to adapt
                            and take my hard skills and make them work for whatever the company needs. To sum up, I'm confident that I can make an immediate impact on your company. I hope to hear from you soon.
